                    <b>Prince Prithvi Narayan Shah's</b> education began at age five through the appropriate ceremony.
                    At that
                    time, the responsibility to educate him was given to Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal, They were
                    the Upadhyayas who worked in the palace as astrologers, where they were also known as Jyotishi or
                    Jaisi[citation needed]. Even though the Gurus provided his primary education, the duty of developing
                    his character was taken by Queen Chandra Pravawati[citation needed]. It is said that seeing the
                    prince of neighboring states Tanahun, Lamjung, and Kaski indulged in excess pleasure, Chandra
                    Pravawati kept Prithvi Narayan Shah away from pleasurable and wrong pursuits. That is why no traces
                    of pleasurable pursuits and diversion can be found in his early life.
